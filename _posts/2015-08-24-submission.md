You are the monster in this game. 
You need to protect your village from the humans, until they declare peace.
You'll see a white dove fly over when that happens.

Until that happens, you'll just have to kill the humans.

Controls: WASD / Arrow keys.

Everything is made from scratch, the art, music, sound effects, particles and all scripts.
